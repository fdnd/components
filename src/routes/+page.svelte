<h2>Hi ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>
  You've reached the component library and styleguide of Frontend Design & Development (FDND), an
  Associate Degree programme at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS). For our
  microsites we use the components as defined in this project, it is intended for internal use and
  as we strive to be an open source (GPLv3) Higher Ed. programme we intend to share everything that
  is not GDPR sensitive.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  It's a component library for FDND students and teachers. It implements the FDND styleguide and is
  actively maintained as it's components are used throughout our microsite environment.
