<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Frontend Design & Development (FDND) is an Associate Degree programme at the Amsterdam University
  of Applied Sciences (AUAS). For our microsites we use the components as defined in this NPM
  package. This project is intended for internal use but as we strive to be an open source (GPLv3)
  Higher Ed. programme we intend to share everything that is not GDPR sensitive.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  It's a component library for FDND students and teachers. It implements the FDND styleguide and is
  actively maintained as it's components are used throughout our microsite environment.
